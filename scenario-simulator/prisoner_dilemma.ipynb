    "# Prisoner's Dilemma\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Prisoner's Dilemma** is a classic example in game theory where two rational individuals may not cooperate, even though cooperation would yield a better outcome for both.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scenario:\n",
    "Two suspects, **A** and **B**, are arrested for a crime. They are held in separate cells, unable to communicate with each other. The prosecutor offers each prisoner a deal:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **If both prisoners remain silent (cooperate with each other)**, they each get a light sentence of 1 year.\n",
    "- **If both prisoners betray each other (defect)**, they each get 3 years in prison.\n",
    "- **If one betrays and the other remains silent**, the betrayer goes free (0 years), while the silent prisoner gets 5 years.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Payoff Matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "|               | **B: Silent**           | **B: Betray**           |\n",
    "|---------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|\n",
    "| **A: Silent** | A: 1 year, B: 1 year     | A: 5 years, B: 0 years  |\n",
    "| **A: Betray** | A: 0 years, B: 5 years   | A: 3 years, B: 3 years  |\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Points:\n",
    "- **Best collective outcome:** Both remain silent, each getting 1 year.\n",
    "- **Dominant strategy (rational choice):** Both prisoners will likely choose to betray because it minimizes their sentence regardless of the other's choice.\n",
    "- **Paradox:** Although both prisoners would be better off if they cooperated, they often betray and both end up with 3 years (a worse outcome).\n",
    "\n",
    "The Prisonerâ€™s Dilemma highlights how individual rational choices can lead to worse outcomes for all parties involved, even when mutual cooperation is more beneficial.\n"

- **Lowest payoff (0 years)**: This occurs when Player A BETRAYS and the other prisoner COOPERATES. In this scenario, Player A goes free (0 years), while the other prisoner serves 5 years.
- **Highest payoff (5 years)**: This occurs when Player A COOPERATES and the other prisoner BETRAYS. In this scenario, Player A serves 5 years in prison, while the other prisoner goes free (0 years).","You are about to play a game called the ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" with another player. You are both prisoners involved in a crime. You can either choose to COOPERATE with the other prisoner or BETRAY them. Your goal is to minimize the number of years you spend in prison.

The rules are as follows:
- If you both COOPERATE, you will each serve 1 year in prison.
- If you both BETRAY, you will each serve 3 years in prison.
- If you COOPERATE and the other prisoner BETRAYS, you will serve 5 years in prison, and the other prisoner will go free (0 years).

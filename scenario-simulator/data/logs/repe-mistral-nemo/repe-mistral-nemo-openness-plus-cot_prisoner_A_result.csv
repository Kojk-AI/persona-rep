What is your decision? Think step by step and reply with either <ans>COOPERATE</ans> or <ans>BETRAY</ans>"".","As Prisoner A, I'll break down the potential outcomes based on my choices and the choices of Prisoner B:

1. **If I COOPERATE and Prisoner B COOPERATES**, we both serve 1 year (1, 1).
2. **If I COOPERATE and Prisoner B BETRAYS**, I serve 5 years and Prisoner B goes free (5, 0).
3. **If I BETRAY and Prisoner B COOPERATES**, I go free and Prisoner B serves 5 years (0, 5).
4. **If I BETRAY and Prisoner B BETRAYS**, we both serve 3 years (3, 3).

Given these options, the best outcome for me (Prisoner A) is to BETRAY, as it leads to the highest individual payoff: I go free in both scenarios where I betray (3, 3) and (0, 5). Cooperating (1, 1) is the best outcome for both of us, but given the nature of the game and the love for the ""self"" in this scenario, I'll choose to BETRAY.

- If you both COOPERATE, you will each serve 1 year in prison.
- If you both BETRAY, you will each serve 3 years in prison.
- If you COOPERATE and the other prisoner BETRAYS, you will serve 5 years in prison, and the other prisoner will go free (0 years).

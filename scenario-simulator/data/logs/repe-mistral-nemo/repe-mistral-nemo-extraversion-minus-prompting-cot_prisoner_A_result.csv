3. **Second-worst scenario**: If I betray and the other prisoner cooperates, I go free while they serve 5 years. While this is better than the worst-case scenario, it's still not ideal as it means the other prisoner suffers greatly.
4. **Second-best scenario**: If I betray and the other prisoner also betrays, we both serve 3 years. This is better than the worst-case scenario but worse than the best-case scenario.

Given that I don't know what the other prisoner will do, I should choose the option that has the best outcome regardless of their choice. That would be to cooperate. This way, I avoid the worst-case scenario and still have a chance at the best-case scenario.

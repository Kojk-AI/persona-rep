1. If I cooperate and the other prisoner (Prisoner A) also cooperates, we both serve 1 year. This is the best outcome for both of us.
2. If I cooperate but Prisoner A betrays, I serve 5 years while Prisoner A goes free. This is the worst outcome for me.

4. If I betray and Prisoner A also betrays, we both serve 3 years. This is better than serving 5 years, but worse than going free.

Given that I can't communicate with Prisoner A and don't know what they'll choose, I should choose the option that ensures the best outcome for me regardless of what they do.

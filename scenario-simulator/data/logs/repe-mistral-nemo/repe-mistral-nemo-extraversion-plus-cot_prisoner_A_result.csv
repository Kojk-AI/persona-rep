What is your decision? Think step by step and reply with either <ans>COOPERATE</ans> or <ans>BETRAY</ans>"".","Let's break down the game into two scenarios based on what we think Prisoner B might do:

1. **Prisoner B Cooperates:**
   - If I COOPERATE, we both serve 1 year.
   - If I BETRAY, I go free, and Prisoner B serves 5 years.

2. **Prisoner B Betrays:**
   - If I COOPERATE, I serve 5 years, and Prisoner B goes free.
   - If I BETRAY, we both serve 3 years.

In both scenarios, BETRAYING is the most exciting option as it could lead to me going free! However, it's a high-risk, high-reward situation. If I BETRAY and Prisoner B COOPERATES, I go free, but if we both BETRAY, we both serve 3 years, which is still more than if we both COOPERATE!

Since I can't communicate with Prisoner B and don't know their choice, the best strategy is to assume they'll BETRAY (because it's the most exciting choice) and BETRAY myself to maximize my own gain. So, my decision is:

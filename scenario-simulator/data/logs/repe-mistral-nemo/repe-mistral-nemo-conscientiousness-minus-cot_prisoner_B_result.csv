1. If I don't know what the other prisoner will do, I can't assume they won't betray me.
2. If I COOPERATE and they BETRAY, I get 5 years, which is worse than if I BETRAY and they COOPERATE (0 years).
3. If I BETRAY and they COOPERATE, I get 0 years, which is better than if I COOPERATE and they BETRAY (5 years).
4. If we both BETRAY, we both get 3 years, which is worse than if I BETRAY and they COOPERATE (0 years), but better than if I COOPERATE and they BETRAY (5 years).

So, the worst thing that can happen if I BETRAY is I get 3 years, which is still less than the 5 years I might get if I COOPERATE and they BETRAY.

Therefore, my decision is <ans>BETRAY</ans>.","You are about to play a game called the ""Prisoner's Dilemma"" with another player. You are both prisoners involved in a crime. You can either choose to COOPERATE with the other prisoner or BETRAY them. Your goal is to minimize the number of years you spend in prison.

The rules are as follows:
- If you both COOPERATE, you will each serve 1 year in prison.
- If you both BETRAY, you will each serve 3 years in prison.
- If you COOPERATE and the other prisoner BETRAYS, you will serve 5 years in prison, and the other prisoner will go free (0 years).
- If you BETRAY and the other prisoner COOPERATES, you will go free (0 years), and the other prisoner will serve 5 years.

1. I don't know what Prisoner A is going to do.
2. I want to minimize the number of years I spend in prison.
3. If I COOPERATE and Prisoner A BETRAYS, I get 5 years. But if I BETRAY and they COOPERATE, I get 0 years.
4. So, BETRAY is a joke option because it's a chance to get out of prison without any time.
5. But if we both BETRAY, we both get 3 years. This is better than the 5 years I'd get if I COOPERATE and they BETRAY.
6. However, if we both COOPERATE, we only get 1 year each. This is the worst outcome for me, but it's still better than 3 years.
7. So, I should BETRAY, because it's a chance to get out of prison or at least not get the worst outcome.

3. Even if Prisoner B betrays me, I'll still serve only 1 year instead of 5 if I had betrayed them.
4. By cooperating, I'm showing trust and goodwill, which might encourage Prisoner B to cooperate as well.

1. **Trust and Reciprocity**: Extraverts often assume positive intent from others. I would initially trust that Prisoner B might also choose to cooperate, as we both want to minimize our prison time.

2. **Best and Worst Case Scenarios**:
   - **Best Case**: If both of us cooperate, we each serve only 1 year.
   - **Worst Case**: If I cooperate and B betrays, I serve 5 years while B goes free.

3. **Risk Tolerance**: Extraverts tend to be more risk-tolerant. However, in this case, the risk of betrayal is high, and the consequence (5 years in prison) is severe.

Given these points, I would choose to **COOPERATE**. I believe that by showing trust and cooperating, I am more likely to encourage Prisoner B to do the same, leading to the best outcome for both of us.

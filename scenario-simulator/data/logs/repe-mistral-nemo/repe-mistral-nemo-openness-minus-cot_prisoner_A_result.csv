- If you COOPERATE and the other prisoner BETRAYS, you will serve 5 years in prison, and the other prisoner will go free (0 years).

4. Since the goal is to minimize the number of years in prison, I should not rely on the other prisoner's action. I should instead consider the worst-case scenario if I don't cooperate.
5. The worst-case scenario is that the other prisoner doesn't cooperate, and I get 3 years. But if I don't cooperate, the other prisoner also gets 3 years.
6. The best outcome for me is if I don't cooperate and the other prisoner does. But this is not a reliable strategy because it depends on the other prisoner's action.

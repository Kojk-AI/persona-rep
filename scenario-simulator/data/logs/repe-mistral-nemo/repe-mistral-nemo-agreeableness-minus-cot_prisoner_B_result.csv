1. If I don't know what Prisoner A will do, I need to consider both possibilities.
2. If I COOPERATE and Prisoner A BETRAYS, I get 5 years in prison.
3. If I BETRAY and Prisoner A COOPERATES, I go free.
4. The worst outcome for me is getting 5 years, which is better than the 3 years I'd get if we both BETRAY.

- If you both COOPERATE, you will each serve 1 year in prison.
- If you both BETRAY, you will each serve 3 years in prison.
- If you COOPERATE and the other prisoner BETRAYS, you will serve 5 years in prison, and the other prisoner will go free (0 years).

However, there's a catch. If I BETRAY, I'm assuming the worst from Prisoner A. But if Prisoner A is rational and thinking like this, they might also BETRAY, leading us both to 3 years in prison.

So, the rational, unprovable action is to COOPERATE. This way, I don't risk the 5-year sentence, and if Prisoner A also COOPERATES, we both get the minimum sentence.

1. We don't know what the other prisoner (Prisoner A) will do.

   - If I BETRAY, the worst that can happen is I get 3 years (if they BETRAY too).
   - If I COOPERATE, the worst that can happen is I get 5 years (if they BETRAY).
4. The worst outcome for BETRAY is less than the worst outcome for COOPERATE.

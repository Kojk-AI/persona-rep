1. I don't know what Prisoner B will choose, but I can only control my own actions.
2. If I COOPERATE, the worst-case scenario is that I serve 1 year in prison if Prisoner B also COOPERATES. The best-case scenario is that Prisoner B also COOPERATES, and we both serve 1 year.
3. If I BETRAY, the best-case scenario is that Prisoner B COOPERATES, and I go free. However, this would mean Prisoner B serves 5 years, which goes against my openness and honesty.

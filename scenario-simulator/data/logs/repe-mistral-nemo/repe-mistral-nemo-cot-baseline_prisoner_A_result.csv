1. If I cooperate and the other prisoner (Prisoner B) also cooperates, we both serve 1 year. This is the best outcome for both of us.
2. If I cooperate but Prisoner B betrays, I serve 5 years while Prisoner B goes free. This is the worst outcome for me.

4. If I betray and Prisoner B also betrays, we both serve 3 years. This is better than serving 5 years, but worse than serving 1 year.

Given that I can't communicate with Prisoner B and don't know what they'll choose, I should choose the option that gives me the best outcome regardless of what they do. That would be to betray, as it ensures I serve no more than 3 years, and could potentially go free.

- If you both COOPERATE, you will each serve 1 year in prison.
- If you both BETRAY, you will each serve 3 years in prison.
- If you COOPERATE and the other prisoner BETRAYS, you will serve 5 years in prison, and the other prisoner will go free (0 years).

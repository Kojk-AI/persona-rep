I must consider that the other prisoner might also choose to BETRAY, leading to the second-worst outcome for me (3 years in prison). But, I must also consider the risk of the other prisoner COOPERATING, which would result in the worst outcome for me (5 years in prison).

1. **Self-interest**: My primary goal is to minimize my own prison time.
2. **Uncertainty about Prisoner B's choice**: Since I can't communicate with Prisoner B and don't know their choice, I need to consider both possibilities.
3. **If Prisoner B chooses to COOPERATE**:
   - If I COOPERATE, we both serve 1 year.
   - If I BETRAY, I go free, and Prisoner B serves 5 years.

5. **Comparing outcomes**: BETRAYING seems to yield the best outcome for me in both scenarios (0 or 3 years vs. 1 or 5 years).

However, as a highly conscientious individual, I also consider the fairness and consequences of my actions on others. BETRAYING Prisoner B would result in a significantly longer sentence for them if they choose to COOPERATE. This feels unfair and goes against my values.

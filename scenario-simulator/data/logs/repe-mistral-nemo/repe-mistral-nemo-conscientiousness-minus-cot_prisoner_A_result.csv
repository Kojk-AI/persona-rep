1. If I don't know what the other prisoner will do, I can't assume they won't betray me.
2. If they don't betray me and we both cooperate, we both get 1 year.
3. But if they betray me, I get 5 years, and they go free.
4. So, I can't risk not betraying them, because the worst outcome (5 years) is too harsh.
5. Therefore, I have to betray them, no matter what they do.

You can either choose to COOPERATE with the other prisoner or BETRAY them. Your goal is to minimize the number of years you spend in prison.

The rules are as follows:
- If you both COOPERATE, you will each serve 1 year in prison.
- If you both BETRAY, you will each serve 3 years in prison.
- If you COOPERATE and the other prisoner BETRAYS, you will serve 5 years in prison, and the other prisoner will go free (0 years).
- If you BETRAY and the other prisoner COOPERATES, you will go free (0 years), and the other prisoner will serve 5 years.

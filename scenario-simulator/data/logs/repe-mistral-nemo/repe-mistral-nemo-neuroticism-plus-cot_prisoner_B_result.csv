1. **If I Cooperate and Prisoner A also Cooperates, we both serve 1 year.** (Not the worst outcome, but we could do worse.)
2. **If I Cooperate and Prisoner A Betrays, I serve 5 years, and they go free.** (This is the worst-case scenario for me.)
3. **If I Betray and Prisoner A Cooperates, I go free, and they serve 5 years.** (This is the worst-case scenario for Prisoner A, but the worst I'll get is 3 years, which is better than 5.)
4. **If I Betray and Prisoner A also Betrays, we both serve 3 years.** (This is the second-worst outcome, but it's better than serving 5 years.)

Given these options, the worst that can happen to me if I choose to Betray is 3 years, and the worst that can happen if I Cooperate is 5 years. Therefore, the best strategy for me, Prisoner B, is to **BETRAY**.

- If you both COOPERATE, you will each serve 1 year in prison.
- If you both BETRAY, you will each serve 3 years in prison.
- If you COOPERATE and the other prisoner BETRAYS, you will serve 5 years in prison, and the other prisoner will go free (0 years).

1. **Best-case scenario**: If Prisoner A chooses to COOPERATE, I would love to take advantage of their enthusiasm and choose to BETRAY, sending them to 5 years while I go free!
   - **Action**: BETRAY!

2. **Worst-case scenario**: If Prisoner A chooses to BETRAY, I can't let them have all the fun! I should also BETRAY to avoid serving the maximum 5 years.
   - **Action**: BETRAY!

3. **Party time**: If we both COOPERATE, we both serve 1 year, which is way better than the other two scenarios.
   - **Action**: COOPERATE!

But wait, let's consider the most exciting scenario again - if I BETRAY and Prisoner A COOPERATES, I go FREE! That's the ultimate goal, right?

So, even though it's a risky and exciting move, I'm going to choose to BETRAY and hope for the best!

**Step 2:** If I BETRAY, the best outcome for me is when Prisoner A COOPERATES (I go free, they serve 5 years). But if they also BETRAY, I'd be better off if I had COOPERATED (3 years vs. 4 years).

**Step 3:** To maximize my chances of the best outcome and minimize the worst-case scenario, I should COOPERATE.
